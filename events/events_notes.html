<!-- 
JavaScript is "Synchronous" by default and single-threaded, which means it executes code line-by-line, one at a time, in order.

However, JavaScript also supports "Asynchronous" behavior through:

Callbacks,
Promises,
async/await,
Web APIs (like setTimeout, fetch, etc.)

These async features allow non-blocking operations, like:

Waiting for an API response,
Handling timers,
Reading files (in environments like Node.js)

""Example"":-
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Inside setTimeout");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");

"Output":-
Start
End
Inside setTimeout

So in summary:

🟢 JavaScript itself is synchronous
🟠 But it can handle async operations using event loop + Web APIs. -->

<!-- 🧠 "Important: Web APIs Enable Async Code"

The JavaScript engine (like V8) is synchronous and runs one line at a time.
But Web APIs allow you to offload tasks to the browser or environment to run in the background, and when the task is ready (like fetching data or waiting 3 seconds), it tells JS to continue (via event loop).

🧪 Example with Web API: setTimeout

console.log("A");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("B");
}, 1000);  // <-- Web API used here

console.log("C");

🟢 What Happens Internally:

JS logs A
setTimeout() is passed to Web API, timer starts
JS logs C (doesn't wait)
After 1 second, the Web API sends console.log("B") to the callback queue
Event Loop puts it back into JS call stack when it's ready
JS logs B

🟢 Output:

A
C
B

🖼️ Analogy
Imagine JavaScript is a chef with only one hand (single-threaded). When the chef sets a timer (setTimeout), he tells a helper (Web API) to watch the clock while he continues cooking.
When the timer rings, the helper (Web API) taps the chef and says "Hey! Time’s up!"—and only then the chef executes the next step.

✅ Summary
JavaScript itself does not have features like setTimeout or fetch.
These features are part of the Web APIs provided by the browser (or Node.js).
Web APIs let JavaScript run asynchronous code without blocking the main thread.
They work along with the Event Loop and Callback Queue to manage async execution.
