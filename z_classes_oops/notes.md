# javascript and classes

## IS JS is a OOP language?
-JavaScript can be used as an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, but it's not purely OOP like Java or C++. Instead, it's a multi-paradigm language â€” meaning it supports:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Functional Programming

Procedural Programming

"JavaScript is prototype-based, not class-based at its core.
Even though ES6 introduced class, it's just syntactic sugar over the underlying prototype chain."
